            %p I kind of bounced around after the Army and did a lot of different things.  Then I found programming and have been doing it for several years now.  I love teaching and mentoring people to become web developers.  When I am not coding (which is most of the time) I love riding my motorcycle.  Not sure if it was mid-life or just a real desire to own a sports bike but I sure do love mine.  Feel free to hit me up if you have any questions, unless it is Football day, because I will be supporting my AZ Cardinals.
