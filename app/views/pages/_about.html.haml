            %p Bob has been lucky since being honorably discharged from the Army to find his way to software development. Bob has been programming for several years now. Additionally, he loves teaching and mentoring new web developers. When Bob is not coding (which is most of the time) he loves riding his motorcycle, and cheering for The Arizona Cardinals. Bob is a proud father of one and just this summer was able to drive cross county to help his daughter settle in to earn her PHd. in Chemistry at the University of Wisconsin Madison.
